# Webhook System

The TrusTrove indexer provides a webhook system for external systems to subscribe to real-time event notifications.

## Overview

Webhooks allow external systems to receive HTTP POST notifications when specific events occur on-chain. The system supports:

- **Invoice lifecycle events**: created, funded, repaid, defaulted, listed, shipped, confirmed
- **Pool events**: deposit, withdrawal, yield distribution

## Architecture

### Payload Schema (v1.0)

All webhook deliveries use a versioned envelope. This is a real `invoice.created` body as sent by the delivery worker, pretty-printed:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "buyer": "GDSCOJVNZ4JUVWZ5O6VBTUGOH4ZE22QJ6WMOYWHB3FEDQ2APJ2RQEIHY",
    "issuer": "GCV5ODH3SMUDETURTOQPQ7TD2YI4YS6DZMMXDFLSWLGBFZTCHYL6LDNW",
    "status": "Created",
    "due_date": 1798675200,
    "created_at": 1790763125,
    "face_value": "1000000000",
    "invoice_id": "9c4e1f0a7b3d52e8c6a1f4b09d7e3a5c2f8b6d0e4a19c7f3b5d2e8a6c0f4b1d9",
    "discount_bps": 250,
    "funded_amount": "0"
  },
  "ledger": 4948964,
  "event_id": "0021255638529081344-0000000001",
  "event_type": "invoice.created",
  "contract_id": "CA4O3MR7LWHRSUDBNU6FY6UDFFYBN7TGBZXBDZB4OYYXFYXIFJ6RJF6B",
  "occurred_at": "2026-09-30T10:12:05Z",
  "schema_version": "1.0"
}
```

The payload is stored as PostgreSQL `JSONB` and sent as Postgres renders it, so key order and whitespace are not the order the fields are defined in. Parse the JSON; don't depend on its layout (and see [Verifying signatures](#verifying-signatures) for why you must verify the raw bytes).

#### Where each field comes from

Envelope fields are on-chain facts taken from the event that triggered the
delivery, not from the moment the worker sent it:

- `event_id`, `ledger` and `contract_id` come from the Soroban event itself, so
  a re-indexed historical event keeps its original identity.
  - `event_id` is the Soroban RPC event ID: a 19-digit, zero-padded TOID, a
    hyphen, and a 10-digit event index (`0021255638529081344-0000000001`). The
    TOID's high 32 bits are the `ledger`. It is unique per on-chain event, which
    makes it the key to de-duplicate on.
  - `contract_id` is the contract that emitted the event (the invoice contract
    for `invoice.*`, the pool contract for `pool.*`).
- `occurred_at` is the **ledger close time** of that ledger, never the indexer's
  wall clock, formatted as RFC 3339 in UTC with second precision. A delivery
  retried an hour later, or an event replayed after a resync, still reports when
  it happened on-chain.

`data` is read back from the invoice row the listener just updated, so it
reflects post-transaction state rather than what happened to be in the event
arguments:

- Invoice events (`invoice.*`) carry `invoice_id`, `issuer`, `buyer`,
  `face_value`, `discount_bps`, `funded_amount`, `due_date`, `status`,
  `created_at` and the lifecycle timestamps `funded_at`, `shipped_at`,
  `buyer_confirmed_at`, `repaid_at`.
  - `invoice_id` is the on-chain `BytesN<32>` invoice ID as 64 lowercase hex
    characters.
  - `face_value` and `funded_amount` are decimal strings in the asset's smallest
    unit (7 decimal places for USDC, so `"1000000000"` is 100 USDC).
    `due_date`, `created_at` and the lifecycle timestamps are Unix seconds.
- Lifecycle timestamps that have not happened yet are **absent** from the
  payload, not zero. Treat a missing key as "not reached".
- Pool events (`pool.*`) carry `account`, `amount` and, when the contract
  reports them, `shares`, `new_balance`, `yield_amount` and `total_shares`.

### Supported Event Types

| Event Type               | Description                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `invoice.created`        | New invoice created          |
| `invoice.funded`         | Invoice funded by pool       |
| `invoice.repaid`         | Invoice repaid by buyer      |
| `invoice.defaulted`      | Invoice defaulted            |
| `invoice.listed`         | Invoice listed for financing |
| `invoice.shipped`        | Invoice marked as shipped    |
| `invoice.confirmed`      | Delivery confirmed by buyer  |
| `pool.deposit`           | User deposited to pool       |
| `pool.withdrawal`        | User withdrew from pool      |
| `pool.yield_distributed` | Yield distributed to LPs     |

> **Known issue:** the envelope's `event_type` always uses the names above, but
> the subscription lookup currently compares a subscription's `event_types`
> against the raw contract event name (for example `InvoiceCreated`) instead of
> the public name. A subscription that lists `invoice.created` therefore receives
> no deliveries today. Subscribe with the public names above; they will start
> matching once the lookup is fixed.

### Signatures

Each webhook delivery is signed with HMAC-SHA256 using the subscription's secret:

```
X-TrusTrove-Signature: sha256=<hex_digest>
X-TrusTrove-Timestamp: <unix_timestamp>
```

- The signature is `HMAC_SHA256(secret, timestamp + "." + body)`, where `body`
  is the exact request body bytes and `timestamp` is the `X-TrusTrove-Timestamp`
  header value.
- The digest is lowercase hex, prefixed with `sha256=`.
- The timestamp is Unix time in **seconds** at the moment of the attempt. Every
  retry is signed again with a fresh timestamp, so a retried delivery still
  passes a tolerance check.

#### Verifying signatures

Verify every request before trusting it:

1. Take the **raw request body bytes**. Don't parse and re-serialize the JSON
   first: re-encoding changes the bytes and the signature won't match.
2. Reject the request if `X-TrusTrove-Timestamp` is more than 5 minutes away
   from your clock, in either direction.
3. Recompute `sha256=` + hex(HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp + "." + body)) and
   compare it to `X-TrusTrove-Signature` in constant time.

Node.js (Express):

```js
const crypto = require("node:crypto");
const express = require("express");

const SECRET = process.env.TRUSTROVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
const TOLERANCE_SECONDS = 5 * 60;

function verifyTrusTroveSignature(rawBody, timestamp, signature, secret) {
  if (!/^\d+$/.test(timestamp ?? "")) return false;
  const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  if (Math.abs(now - Number(timestamp)) > TOLERANCE_SECONDS) return false;

  const expected =
    "sha256=" +
    crypto
      .createHmac("sha256", secret)
      .update(`${timestamp}.`)
      .update(rawBody)
      .digest("hex");
  const a = Buffer.from(expected);
  const b = Buffer.from(signature ?? "");
  return a.length === b.length && crypto.timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}

const app = express();

// express.raw() keeps the exact bytes that were signed. Don't use
// express.json() on this route: re-serialized JSON won't match the signature.
app.post(
  "/webhooks/trustrove",
  express.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (req, res) => {
    const ok = verifyTrusTroveSignature(
      req.body,
      req.get("X-TrusTrove-Timestamp"),
      req.get("X-TrusTrove-Signature"),
      SECRET,
    );
    if (!ok) return res.sendStatus(401);

    const event = JSON.parse(req.body.toString("utf8"));
    // Deliveries are at-least-once: skip event.event_id values you've already
    // processed, then hand the event to a queue and answer quickly.
    res.sendStatus(204);
  },
);
```

Go (`net/http`). This function is also compiled and run against the indexer's
own signer as `Example_verifySignature` in
`indexer/webhooks/signature_example_test.go`, so keep the two in sync:

```go
const signatureTolerance = 5 * time.Minute

func verifyTrusTroveSignature(secret string, rawBody []byte, timestamp, signature string, now time.Time) bool {
	ts, err := strconv.ParseInt(timestamp, 10, 64)
	if err != nil {
		return false
	}
	if age := now.Sub(time.Unix(ts, 0)); age > signatureTolerance || age < -signatureTolerance {
		return false
	}
	mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secret))
	mac.Write([]byte(timestamp + "."))
	mac.Write(rawBody)
	expected := "sha256=" + hex.EncodeToString(mac.Sum(nil))
	return hmac.Equal([]byte(expected), []byte(signature))
}

// In the handler, read the body once and verify those bytes:
//
//	body, err := io.ReadAll(http.MaxBytesReader(w, r.Body, 1<<20))
//	if err != nil || !verifyTrusTroveSignature(secret, body,
//		r.Header.Get("X-TrusTrove-Timestamp"), r.Header.Get("X-TrusTrove-Signature"), time.Now()) {
//		http.Error(w, "invalid signature", http.StatusUnauthorized)
//		return
//	}
```

**Replay protection** comes from two checks together. The timestamp window
rejects a captured request replayed more than 5 minutes later, and
de-duplicating on `event_id` (which you need anyway, see
[Delivery Guarantees](#delivery-guarantees)) makes a replay inside the window
harmless.

**Endpoint security:** subscription URLs are not validated yet. There is no
check for HTTPS or for private or internal addresses; that belongs to the
subscription management API in
[#808](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-app/issues/808). Use an `https://`
endpoint, keep the signing secret out of source control and logs, and rotate it
if it leaks.

### Delivery Semantics

What a receiver sees, per attempt:

- **Request:** `POST` to the subscription URL with the envelope as the body,
  `Content-Type: application/json`, the two signature headers above, and Go's
  default `User-Agent` (`Go-http-client/1.1`, or `Go-http-client/2.0` when
  the endpoint negotiates HTTP/2).
- **Success** is any `2xx` status. Every other status (including `3xx` that
  isn't followed, `4xx` and `5xx`) and every network error counts as a failed
  attempt. Answer quickly and process asynchronously.
- **Timeout:** the whole attempt (connect, send, response headers and body) has
  10 seconds.
- **Redirects** are followed (Go's default, up to 10). A `301`, `302` or `303`
  turns the `POST` into a `GET` without a body, so register the final URL.
- **Response storage:** on success, up to the first 4096 bytes of your response
  body are stored in `webhook_deliveries.last_response`. On failure only the
  status code (`last_status`) and an error message (`last_error`, for example
  `non-2xx response: 500`) are stored.
- **Ordering and duplicates:** delivery is at-least-once, with no
  de-duplication per subscription, and deliveries are not ordered. A retried
  delivery can arrive after later events. De-duplicate on `event_id` and use
  `ledger` / `occurred_at` (or the invoice's lifecycle timestamps) to order
  events.

What happens in the queue:

- The worker polls every **5 seconds** and claims up to **50** due deliveries
  per poll, attempting up to `WEBHOOK_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` of them in parallel.
  A new delivery is first attempted on the next poll after the event is indexed.
- `webhook_deliveries.status` is `pending` while a delivery is waiting for its
  first attempt or a retry, `delivered` after a `2xx`, and `dead_letter` once
  retries are exhausted. Dead-lettered rows are never retried automatically.
- Delivery rows are only created for subscriptions that are active when the
  event is indexed. Rows whose subscription is later set to `active = false`
  are not attempted; they stay `pending` until it is re-activated.

### Delivery Guarantees

**Delivery is at-least-once, never exactly-once.** Subscribe idempotently and
de-duplicate on `event_id`: a subscriber that returns 2xx slowly, an indexer
that is killed mid-attempt, or two indexer replicas running during a rolling
deploy can all result in the same `event_id` being delivered more than once.

The queue guarantees the weaker property that no delivery is lost and no two
workers attempt the same row at the same time:

- The worker calls `db.ClaimPendingDeliveries`, which **claims** rows instead of
  merely reading them. The read is a single statement that locks the candidate
  rows with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and stamps `locked_until`, so a
  concurrent claim by another worker (or another replica of the same indexer)
  gets a disjoint batch.
- A claimed row is invisible to other workers until either the attempt records
  an outcome (`MarkDeliverySuccess`, `MarkDeliveryRetry` and
  `MarkDeliveryDeadLetter` all clear `locked_until`) or the lock expires.
- If a worker dies after claiming and before recording an outcome, the row
  stays `pending` and becomes claimable again once `locked_until` passes. That
  is the case in which a subscriber may see an event twice.
- Rows are never deleted on success; they move to `delivered`, so the queue can
  be audited.

### Worker Configuration

The delivery worker attempts a batch of deliveries from a bounded pool that
shares a single `http.Client`, so TCP/TLS connections are reused across
deliveries instead of paying a handshake per POST. Environment variables read
by `indexer/config`:

- `WEBHOOK_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` (default `8`): how many deliveries one batch
  attempts in parallel. Keep it small when your subscribers rate-limit inbound
  traffic. Non-positive values fall back to the default.
- The claim lock TTL is `db.DefaultClaimLockTTL` (60s) and must stay comfortably
  above the worker's HTTP timeout so an in-flight attempt is never handed to a
  second worker.

The poll interval (5s), batch size (50) and HTTP timeout (10s) are the defaults
in `webhooks.DefaultWorkerConfig` and are not configurable through the
environment.

### Retry Logic

A delivery gets **5 attempts**: the first attempt plus 4 retries with
exponential backoff.

| Attempt | When                                              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | On the next poll after the event is indexed       |
| 2       | 20 seconds after attempt 1 fails                  |
| 3       | 40 seconds after attempt 2 fails                  |
| 4       | 80 seconds after attempt 3 fails                  |
| 5       | 160 seconds after attempt 4 fails                 |
| —       | Attempt 5 fails: marked `dead_letter`, no retries |

- The delay after the _n_-th failed attempt is `10s × 2^n`
  (`backoffBase * (1 << nextAttempt)` in `indexer/webhooks/worker.go`).
- A retry runs on the first poll after its scheduled time, so it can start up to
  one poll interval (5s) later than listed.
- The limit comes from the `webhook_deliveries.max_attempts` column (default
  `5`, set per delivery row by migration `009_add_webhook_subscriptions.sql`),
  not from `WorkerConfig.MaxAttempts`.
- A dead-lettered row shows `attempts = 4`: the counter records the failures
  that were scheduled for a retry, and the final failure sets the status without
  incrementing it.

### Subscription Management

Webhook subscriptions are managed via the database. Use the following tables:

- `webhook_subscriptions`: Stores subscriber URLs, event types, secrets, and active status
- `webhook_deliveries`: Tracks delivery attempts, status, and responses.
  `locked_until` holds the current claim (see
  [Delivery Guarantees](#delivery-guarantees)) and is `NULL` when the row is
  free; migration `010_add_webhook_delivery_locking.sql` added the column.

## Implementation Details

The webhook system was implemented in three phases:

1. **Payload Schema** (#804): Defined versioned JSON envelope and event types in `indexer/webhooks/payload.go`
2. **Subscriptions Table** (#805): Added database schema and Go accessors in `indexer/db/webhooks.go` and migration `009_add_webhook_subscriptions.sql`
3. **Delivery Worker** (#806): Background worker with signing, retry, and dead-letter handling in `indexer/webhooks/worker.go`

At runtime, in `indexer/main.go`:

- **Enqueueing:** the event listener calls `Dispatcher.EnqueueDeliveries`
  (`indexer/webhook/dispatcher.go`) inside the same database transaction that
  applies the event, so an event's `webhook_deliveries` rows commit or roll back
  with the event itself. `BuildEnvelope` in the same file builds the payload.
- **Sending:** `webhooks.NewDeliveryWorker` (`indexer/webhooks/worker.go`) runs
  as a background goroutine alongside the listener and performs every HTTP
  delivery.

`indexer/webhook/dispatcher.go` also contains an older `RunWorker` delivery loop
that is never started; removing it is tracked in
[#879](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-app/issues/879).
